# Samples
- **[simple](./simple/README.md)**: The runtime is integrated with most of the WAMR APP libraries, and a few WASM applications are provided for testing the WAMR APP API set. It uses **built-in libc** and executes apps in **interpreter** mode by default.
- **[littlevgl](./littlevgl/README.md)**: Demonstrating the graphic user interface application usage on WAMR. The whole [LVGL](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl) 2D user graphic library and the UI application are built into WASM application.  It uses **WASI libc** and executes apps in **AOT mode** by default.
- **[gui](./gui/README.md)**: Move the [LVGL](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl) library into the runtime and define a WASM application interface by wrapping the littlevgl API. It uses **WASI libc** and executes apps in **interpreter** mode by default.
